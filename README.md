# AME_Client
This is a generic shell that can run all the AME REST transactions.
Please note that this is just a functional non-aesthetic shell.

Install:

1) You will need Python, Django, and git installed and ability to use command line.
2) Clone this repo. Typically this would be done with this command: 'git clone https://github.com/jazzbox35/AME_Client.git'.
3) Navigate to your repo folder, change director/folder to ame_client_project.
4) Issue command: "python manage.py runserver" after you navigate to the project folder (some installations require "python3").
5) Enter http://localhost:8000/ame_client_app/ in your browser.
6) In order to work the remote server has to be up. If you get an error contact Mike @ jazzbox35@gmail.com.

For custom configuration, see the file:
