# AME_Client_Project
This is a generic shell that can be used to access the AbsoluteMode Engine.
Please note that this is just a functional non-aesthetic shell you can clone and customize.
Also note that this is my first Django program so it looks a bit of a hackjob in the code. Cleanups are envisioned...

Install:

1) You will need Python and Django installed, then clone this repo.
2) Navigate to your repo folder, cd to ame_client_project
3) Issue command: "python manage.py runserver" after you navigate to the project folder.
4) Enter http://localhost:8000/ame_client_app/ in your browser
5) In order to work the remote server has to be up. If you get an error contact Mike @ jazzbox35@gmail.com
