# AME_Client_Project
This is a generic shell that can be used to access the AbsoluteMode Engine.
Please note that this is just a functional non-aesthetic shell you can clone and customize.

You will need Python and Django installed, then clone this repo.

Issue command: "python manage.py runserver" after you navigate to the project folder.

Once installed, run --> http://localhost:8000/ame_client_app/

In order to work the remote server has to be up. If you get an error contact Mike @ jazzbox35@gmail.com
