# AME_Client_Project
This is a generic shell that serves as a very simple demo.
Please note that this is just a functional non-aesthetic shell.
Also note that this is a first Django program which works but is in progress.

Install:

1) You will need Python and Django installed, then clone this repo. 
   Typically this would be done with this command: 'git clone https://github.com/jazzbox35/AME_Client_Project.git'
2) Navigate to your repo folder, cd to ame_client_project
3) Issue command: "python manage.py runserver" after you navigate to the project folder.
4) Enter http://localhost:8000/ame_client_app/ in your browser
5) In order to work the remote server has to be up. If you get an error contact Mike @ jazzbox35@gmail.com
